The package gps_ublox allow to read localization data from the GPS ROVER Ublox, once the base is correctly placed in the outdoor environment and the survey is completed. The rover.launch file will start the communication with the usb /dev/ttyACM0. Localization data are then published in the /ROVER/navrelposned topic, in the NED format. The gps_ublox node, implemented in the gps_ublox.py script, will read this topic and convert the localization data in the PoseWithCovarianceStamped format, useful for the sensor fusion with robot_localization. Before the conversion, the script will verify the value of the flag and will use only data with flag = 23, that is the localization data are obtained in the maximum precision from the GPS RTK. The script will then read the relPosN, relPosHPN, relPosE, relPosHPE (referred to a global frame) and calculate the local cartesian coordinates in terms of x and y. The values are converted in meters, an header with a timestamp is added, a covariance matrix is added, and the data are published in the pose_rtls topic, in the PoseWithCovarianceStamped format.
