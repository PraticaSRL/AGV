The package allow to read localization data from the GPS ROVER. The rover.launch file will start the communication with the usb /dev/ttyACM0. Localization data are then published in the /ROVER/navrelposned topic, in the NED format. Another node (gps_ublox) started separately will read from this topic and convert the localization data in the PoseWithCovarianceStamped format, useful for the sensor fusion with robot_localization.
