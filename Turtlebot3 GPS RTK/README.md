The Turtlebot3-based prototype has been equipped with a Real Time Kinematics GPS System produced by Ublox. The differential drive vehicle will receive the location data from USB and use them to navigate in the outdoor environment. Once the RTK GPS system is started and the survey in complete, the node gps_ublox, implemented through the gps_ublox.py script, will read the localization data from the topic /ROVER/navrelposned (in the NED format), convert them in the PoseWithCovarianceStamped format and publish them in the topic /pose_gps. The robot_localization package will allow the fusion of multiple sources of localization data by mean of Extended Kalman Filters, through which localization data coming from odometry, IMU and GPS RTK system are used to produce an optimal position estimation.
