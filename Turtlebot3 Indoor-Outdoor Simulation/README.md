The mixed indoor/outdoor environment is simulated generating odometry data with a ideal kinematic model of the robot, in the robot_sim node. In the all_sim.py script are also simulated RTLS localization data and GPS localization data, which are generated adding random error to the ideal odometry data produced by robot_sim node. The behavior of the simulated vehicle is visualized in rviz, during the navigation toward some well-known position goals, placed at the vertices of a square. The behavior has been verified in presence of one or two of the localization data (RTLS and/or GPS) and even with no localization data (only odometry and IMU). This simulation has been useful to understand the behavior of the navigation system in a mixed environment, prior to the real-world test.
