The robot_sim node generates odometry data of the robot through an ideal kinematic model, implemented in the robot_sim.cpp file. To simulate a mixed indoor/outdoor environment is used the all_sim.py script, where are simulated both RTLS localization data (which are available indoor) and GPS localization data (which are available outdoor): they are generated adding random error to the ideal odometry data produced by robot_sim node. The behavior of the simulated vehicle is visualized in rviz, during the navigation toward some well-known position goals, placed at the vertices of a square. The behavior of the navigation system has been verified in presence of one or two of the localization data (RTLS and/or GPS) and even with no localization data (only odometry and IMU). This simulation has been useful to understand the behavior of the navigation system in a mixed environment, prior to the real-world test.
